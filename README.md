# Contact Details
# This project is a dynamic and responsive web application built with React. It showcases how to efficiently pass data between components using props and iterate over data using JavaScriptâ€™s .map() method to render dynamic content. The application is designed to be modular, reusable, and scalable, demonstrating core React concepts like data flow and component rendering.
# Key Features:
## Props: Data is passed from parent components to child components using props, which allows for a flexible and maintainable architecture.
## Map: The .map() method is used to dynamically render a list of items based on data passed to the components, improving the user experience with a clean and functional interface.
## Reusable Components: Components are designed to be reusable and can easily be expanded or modified.
